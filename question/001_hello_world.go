/*
This is your first Golang program!

This piece of code is simply going to print hi on your screen and doesn't do anything else.
but there are things you have to take care when running a program!

In order for a program to run you must have a `main` package which is simply declared by writing `package main` at the start of the code.

If you run this question you will see an error, run and see the error and then fix the problem!
